# NOAA_ImpactAnalysis  
This is the summary of an NOAA weather impact analysis conducted as part of a Coursera Reproducible Research course
  
The .Rmd file was converted to html using knit2html with force_v1=TRUE.  As such, the .md file and associated figures can be viewed.  

This contains work mostly in base R with base plot.  It will be good to go back later and do this more efficiently with dplyr and ggplot2.  
  
It might also be interesting to find the full NOAA Storm Database and analyze that.  The missing Katrina deaths in Louisiana in the sample for this project seems like it might distort the reported health impact of hurricances.  Interested in what the full sample show.
